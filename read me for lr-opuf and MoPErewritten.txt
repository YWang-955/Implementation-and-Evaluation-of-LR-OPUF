This is the file used for the control experiments in Chapter 4. 
It contains the lr_opuf.py file and some modified text from the MoPE.ipynb file.
The complete MoPE.ipynb database and design used in the control experiments are cited at: //github.com/AnonymousAppdx/Generic-Framework-for-Modelling-PUFs.

This paper developed the LR-OPUF.py file based on the LR-OPUF protocol. 
Based on this file's logic, we also developed the lr_opuf.py file for a control test. 
Using logistic regression, we verified the LR-OPUF protocol's resistance to modeling attacks.
To run the program, first add the MoPE rewrite script to the Data Preparation module in MoPE.ipynb, 
then place lr_opuf.py in the same database directory (you can also create a new .py file in the library and paste the contents into it). 
First, run the MoPE.ipynb file to obtain the PUF data (CRPs), then run the lr_opuf.py file.
