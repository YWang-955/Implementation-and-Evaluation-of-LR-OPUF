Different read me files in the repository correspond to different code source files, and each read me describes how to use each source file.
Because the virtual machine environment compressed package is large, a new Release is created through the tag to provide downloads of the virtual machine environment and hlpsl file (vbox.zip). 
You can also download the source code at the same time as the Release, which contains other source code and a read me file.
